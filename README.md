# Long Polling Demo Repository

This repository contains a simple demonstration of long polling, a server-side polling technique used in web development for asynchronous data updates.

## Description

Long polling is a technique where the client sends a request to the server, and the server holds the request open until new data is available or a timeout occurs. Once new data is available, the server responds, and the client sends another request to continue the process. This allows for asynchronous data updates without continuous requests from the client.

This demonstration repository includes a sample application using express.js that showcases long polling.
